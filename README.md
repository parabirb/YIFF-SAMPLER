the yiff sampler 3000 samples audio for music production from yiff. that's what it does.

this was done for a music collaboration with zyrn ([twitter](https://twitter.com/zyrnwtf)).

## refreshing
if you want to substitute with new content, run a search query on e6 like [this one](https://e621.net/posts.json?tags=order:favcount%20sound%20male/male&limit=100) and then save it to `e621.json`.

## running
`npm i`, then `npm test`. pretty straightforward.

## special notes
this takes up a lot of space don't be surprised if it takes up like a gigabyte i tried my hardest
